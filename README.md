# Collaborative Workflow Example: RStudio × GitHub × Overleaf 

This repository provides a minimal, fully reproducible example of how to organize collaborative research work using:
- GitHub → version control & collaboration on code
- RStudio → data cleaning, analysis, automatic generation of figures/tables
- Overleaf → writing papers and presentations that pull results directly from the repo

It is intended as a template for PhD students, coauthors, and research teams who want a clean, consistent, automated workflow for empirical work.

Not that this structure is an example of a repository for which data can be shared and is not too large. In a situation for which data cannot be placed in a repo, you must find another general repo structure such as placing your data folders and .Rproj outside the repo but leaving the code folder inside.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository demonstrates how to separate tasks in a collaborative research project:

1. R code lives in code/ and is version-controlled on GitHub
   - Every coauthor can work on the same R scripts.
   - Data cleaning and analysis are reproducible.
   - Figures and tables are generated automatically from R.

2. Outputs (figures & tables) are exported into paper_presentation/
   - Figures → paper_presentation/figures/
   - Tables → paper_presentation/tables/

These folders serve as the single source of truth for Overleaf.

3. Overleaf has Github integration

Instead of manually uploading figures/tables to Overleaf, we use GitHub as the intermediary:

R generates outputs → GitHub tracks them → Overleaf fetches them.

The Overleaf project associated with this example is:

🔗 https://www.overleaf.com/read/sksxfsykywsw

The .tex files on Overleaf simply reference the files stored in this repository, e.g.:
```
\includegraphics{figures/meetings_satisfaction.png}

\input{tables/desc_stats.tex}
```
As long as filenames remain the same, the LaTeX code on Overleaf never needs to be changed so that figures and tables can be updated directly in R.

## How the Workflow Works in Practice 

### Step 1 — Edit or expand R scripts

You modify the code inside code/:
- clean data
- run analyses
- produce tables and figures

### Step 2 — R automatically exports all outputs 

Running the R scripts regenerates:
- updated .png or .pdf figures
- updated .tex tables

These are saved in paper_presentation/figures/ and paper_presentation/tables/.

### Step 3 — Commit & push to GitHub

Once committed, the updated results are immediately available in your Github repo. You only need to pull them to Overleaf with the Github integration of Overleaf.

### Step 4 — Overleaf stays stable

You write your paper/presentation in Overleaf by calling the figures and tables with \includegraphics{} and \input{} commands. You don't have to import manually the figures and tables into Overleaf once the LaTeX code is table, because all file paths stay the same.
The content (figures/tables) updates automatically via GitHub when you modify it in R.

### Result: a fully synchronized workflow

- edit R code
- run
- commit and push
- Pull changes from Github to Overleaf so that Overleaf updates automatically
- coauthors always see the latest results

No more:
- “final_table2_v3_ok_def.tex”
- “last_new_figure_updated_bis.png”
- emailing PDFs between coauthors
- inconsistencies between versions


## Example Included in This Repository

The project includes:
- a small synthetic dataset
- a toy "analysis_code“ exporting a figure, a descriptive statistics table and a regression analysis table
- a Beamer presentation illustrating the workflow

This is intended as a didactic example showing how assets move from: RStudio → GitHub → Overleaf → PDF output

## Contribution & Extensions

This repo can be extended to:
- full papers with multiple sections
- more complex analyses 
- multi-author workflows using Git branching
- fully automated pipelines using {targets} or {drake}
- Quarto integration for unified R+LaTeX reports (Rmarkdown is used here)
- replication packages for journal submissions

Pull requests & issues are welcome.
